# Arduino files to turn it into a USB Rubber Ducky!

These are the files i use in my Arduino for:

- Changing the wallpaper to a David Hassellhoff image in Windows. Adapted for Spanish keyboards.

- Copy a file in a unix system. Adapted for Spanish keyboards.

- Activating narrator in Windows 10. For any keyboard (probably).


**Tested in Arduino Pro Mini (a chinese version) and Windows 10 with spanish keyboard layout.**
